# VisualSort
A visual representation of sorting algorithms. 

The olcPixelGameEnginer is used as the graphics driver for this program.

Visual Sort will offer a visual representation of several sorting algorithms, starging with bubble sort. The viewer will be presented with a graph and set of unsorted bars, which will then be sorted into their correct positions. 

Bubble Sort has been implemented.
Selection Sort has been implemented.

# Purpose
This is a personal portfolio project. I am trying to increase my knowledge of known sorting algorithms and hone my coding skills. 

# Code
The code is heavily commented. Unless the function is obvious, expect some sort of description of what each element does. Perhaps you can learn something as well along the way. 

# Sources
OLC's Pixel Game Engine is used as the Visual Element 
     of this program. It is the graphics library called by the
     classes and functions presented here.
